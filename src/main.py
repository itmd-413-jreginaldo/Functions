Python Functions
This program will explore the use of functions and file modules

Question 1:
Create two functions that convert from radians to degrees (r2d(x)) and from degrees to
radians (d2r(x)) respectively. Save your functions into a separate Python file and import
the file when you write your main program.

Question 2:
Given the complete program, refactor the program to appropriately implement the use of functions
